# Covid-19-Trails-Exploratory-Analysis

The source URL for the data is https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19. This data is available for the general public through ClinicalTrials.gov. It is a database that contains all privately and publicly funded clinical studies conducted around the world.

According to a basic examination of the data, the file contains 4895 rows, 18 columns, and is 5.80 MB in size.

For the COVID-19 vaccine Studies, we will plan the data review below. Let's take a look at some simple meanings of typical clinical trial terminologies before diving into the dataset:

Clinical Trail: A type of clinical study in which participants are assigned to groups that receive one or more intervention/treatment (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes.

Investigator: A person responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at a trial site.

Sponsor: A person or Organization funding the clinical Study.

Observational Study: A clinical Study in which Investigator assess health outcomes in a group of participants.

Enrollment: The number of participants in a clinical study.

Condition: The disease, disorder, syndrome, illness, or injury that is being studied.

Intervention: Include drugs, medical devices, procedures, vaccines, and other products that are either investigational or already available.

Interventional Study: A type of clinical study in which participants are assigned to groups that receive one or more intervention/treatment (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes.

Expanded Access: A way for patients with serious diseases or conditions who cannot participate in a clinical trial to gain access to a medical product

## Conclusion

We have analyzed the candidates for the clinical trials for the years 2020 and 2021. USA and France Lead the world in conducting Covid-19 Trails. Most Undergoing Studies are in Phase 2, with only 7.54% of studies in Phase 4, and 'Industries do max Funding for these Clinical trials.' NIH and US-FEDs fund some studies, and Most Studies aim to be completed by 2020-2025

Through this midterm project, I learned how we could group the data and get the overall count. I discovered more about the Plots and their functionality. It will be a great experience towards my goal to become a Data Scientist. Thank you so much for the opportunity and assistance!
